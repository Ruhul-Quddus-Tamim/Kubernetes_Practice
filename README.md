# Kubernetes in a very layman terms in order for anyone to understand

### Imagine a Restaurant Scenario
Think of your Kubernetes cluster as a restaurant:

1. Nodes: The nodes in your cluster are like different kitchens in the restaurant. Each kitchen can prepare meals (handle requests).
2. Pods: The Pods are like chefs in each kitchen. Each chef specializes in cooking a specific dish (processing a specific type of request).
3. Service: The Kubernetes Service is like the restaurant manager who takes orders from customers and decides which kitchen (node) and chef (Pod) will prepare the meal.

### The Flow of Incoming Traffic (Orders)
Customers Arrive (Incoming Traffic):

Let’s say 5 customers walk into the restaurant at the same time, and they all want different dishes **(requests)**.
These customers place their orders with the restaurant manager **(Kubernetes Service)**. Manager Assigns Orders **(Load Balancer)**:

The manager doesn’t prepare the food but knows which kitchen has chefs (Pods) available to cook the dishes.
The manager can send each order to a different kitchen (node), depending on who has capacity. The manager might send two orders to Kitchen 1 (Node 1), two to Kitchen 2 (Node 2), and one to Kitchen 3 (Node 3).

### Orders are Sent to Kitchens (Traffic Routing):

Now, each kitchen gets the orders they need to prepare. If a kitchen has more than one chef, the order can go to any chef who is free.
Even if a customer’s order lands in Kitchen 1, but the specific dish they want is usually prepared by a chef in Kitchen 2, the order can still be routed to Kitchen 2 **(using kube-proxy)**. This ensures that the order is cooked by the right chef, even if they are in another kitchen.

### Chefs Cook the Meals (Pods Process Requests):

1. Each chef starts cooking the meals they were assigned. If a kitchen is busy, the manager (Service) ensures no single chef gets overwhelmed by distributing the orders evenly.

2. The chefs (Pods) cook the meals (process the requests), and once the food is ready, they send it back to the manager.

3. Meals are Served to Customers (Responses Returned): The manager ensures that the right meal goes back to the right customer, regardless of which kitchen prepared it. This happens quickly and efficiently, so customers don’t need to know or care which kitchen made their meal.

### What Happens with 5 Users?

1. User Requests: When 5 users hit your application (send requests), the LoadBalancer (manager) decides how to distribute these requests across the available nodes (kitchens).

2. Distribution: The LoadBalancer might send some requests to Node 1, some to Node 2, and some to Node 3.

3. Processing: Each node processes the request in one of its Pods (chefs).

4. Cross-Node Requests: If a request lands on Node 1 but needs a Pod on Node 2, the system will automatically forward the request to Node 2 to be handled there.

### How Cross-Node Requests Work
When we talk about cross-node requests in Kubernetes, it’s not about a node forwarding a request to another node because it’s too busy. Instead, it’s about the Kubernetes Service and kube-proxy making sure that any request, no matter where it lands, reaches the correct Pod, even if that Pod is on a different node.

**Scenario:** Node 1 is Busy
1. Request Arrives at Node 1:
- Suppose a user’s request (like visiting a webpage) arrives at Node 1 because the external LoadBalancer (the cloud provider’s load balancer) decided to route it there.
- Node 1 receives the request, but all Pods on Node 1 are currently busy handling other requests.
  
2. Pod Selection (Service and kube-proxy):

- The Service in Kubernetes, along with kube-proxy, looks at all the available Pods that match the Service selector, regardless of which node they are on.
- If Node 1’s Pods are busy and can’t handle the new request, the Service will find a Pod on another node (e.g., Node 2 or Node 3) that can handle the request.

3. Routing the Request:

- Kubernetes uses the kube-proxy to forward the request from Node 1 to the Pod on Node 2 (or Node 3) that is free and ready to handle it.
This forwarding happens behind the scenes, so the user has no idea the request is being processed on a different node.


### In Summary:
> The LoadBalancer acts as a smart manager, distributing traffic (orders) evenly across nodes (kitchens).
> Each node can handle incoming requests, and even if the request is meant for a Pod on another node, it will be automatically routed there.

This ensures high availability and efficient resource use, just like a well-managed restaurant where all kitchens work together to serve customers quickly and efficiently.
